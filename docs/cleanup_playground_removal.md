# Removal of Legacy Playground Route

The `Playground` page and its corresponding `ApiPlayground` component have been retired. Chat functionality now loads from `Chat.tsx`, which renders the `AiPlayground` component.

## Changes

- Deleted `src/pages/Playground.tsx` and `src/components/ApiPlayground.tsx`.
- Removed the `/playground` route and its import from `src/App.tsx`.

These updates clean up unused code associated with the old route.
